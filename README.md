## Introduction
In separation science and analytical chemistry, the prediction of retention times were primarily based on retention coefficients of amino acids or molecular descriptors of metabolites. 

DeepRT is an software for peptide retention prediction, developed collaboratively by BGI-Shenzhen and Intel China, outperforming other software such as ELUDE, GPTime, etc. The algorithm is based on the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm residual network (ResNet) and long short-time memory (LSTM), written based upon the efficient deep learning library MXNet (https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet). If you use DeepRT in your research, please cite: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05368. Currently only the Windows 64 bit version binary package is available. If you have any question, or need other version of DeepRT (Windows 32 bit, Linux, GPU), please contact me (machunwei@genomics.cn).
