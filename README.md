DeepRT is an software for peptide retention prediction, outperforming other software such as ELUDE and GPTime. The algorithm is based on the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm residual network (ResNet) and long short-time memory (LSTM) and the software is written based upon the efficient deep learning library MXNet (https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet). If you use DeepRT in your research, please cite:. Currently only the Windows 64 bit version binary package is available, and if you need other version of DeepRT (Windows 32 bit, Linux, GPU), please contact me (machunwei@genomics.cn).
